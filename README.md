### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tristan, a web and system's developer interested in text and networking.

### Some fun facts about me
- Linux is my favorite operating system
  - Debian and PopOS are my favorite distros
- I like Go, Rust, and C++ (It's like playing "Getting Over It" for me).

### What I'm working on right now.
